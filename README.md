# How does it work?

Pystickynote creates a small QT window for you to jot your ideas down and then display them later on all with a command line tool. On top of that, the note itself is fully customizable allowing you to change colors, alpha, and borders.

# Installation

```
pip3 install pystickynote
```

# Running It

```
<pystickynote/pysn> create <name_of_note> # Displays stickynote window

<pystickynote/pysn> open <name_of_note> # Displays old stickynote

<pystickynote/pysn> delete <name_of_note> # Deletes stickynote

<pystickynote/pysn> list # Displays all notes
```

# Changelog

### Update 1.5:

- Added new entry point: `pysn`

- Added delete function thanks to @synackray

- Fixed error with mouse_offset (possibly still buggy)

- New local version of PySimpleGUIQt for that ^

# Configuration

background_color = #454545
text_color = #fafafa
alpha = 0.8

```

`background_color` = the background hex color for the note

`alpha` = the note window's alpha

`border_width` = border around input box and buttons

`font_size` = font size for text

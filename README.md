# pystickynote

Stickynotes for your desktop easily from the command line!

# How does it work?

Pystickynote creates a small QT window for you to jot your ideas down and then display them later on all with a command line tool. On top of that, the note itself is fully customizable allowing you to change colors, alpha, and borders.

# Installation

```
pip3 install pystickynote
```

# Running It

```
pystickynote create <name_of_note> # Displays stickynote window

pystickynote open <name_of_note> # Displays old stickynote
```
